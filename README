               Genode support for Zynq-based boards
               ====================================


This repository complements the Genode OS framework (https://genode.org) with
the board support needed to use Genode on devices based on Xilinx Zynq SoCs.

To use it, you first need to obtain a clone of Genode:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode.git genode

Now, clone the _genode-zynq.git_ repository to _genode/repos/zynq:

! git clone https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-zynq.git genode/repos/zynq

Create a build directory by executing the following command in the genode
directory:

! ./tool/create_builddir arm_v7a

For enabling the board support, adjust the build-directory configuration
_etc/build.conf_ by adding the following line before the other 'REPOSITORIES'
definitions so that the _zynq_ repository is prioritized over the others.

! REPOSITORIES += $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/zynq
