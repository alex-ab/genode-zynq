               Device drivers needed for scenarios
                 using the FPGA of the Zynq SoC
                     with a custom bitstream

The package requires three ROM sessions: A bitstream 'fpga.bit', a config
'fpga_devices.config' specifying the additional devices and policies passed to
the platform driver once the bitstream has been loaded, and a config
'fpga_drivers.config' for the driver manager.

In return, the package provides a Platform sessiond and a ROM session 'init.config'
that is generated by the driver manager. This ROM is intended to be used by a
sub-init that hosts the dynamically started drivers.
