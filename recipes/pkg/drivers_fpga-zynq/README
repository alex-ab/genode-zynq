               Device drivers needed for scenarios
                 using the FPGA of the Zynq SoC
                     with a custom bitstream

The package requires two ROM sessions ('policy' and 'devices_manager.config')
and a File_system session. The 'policy' ROM is merged with the default config
ROM of the internal platform driver. The 'devices_manager.config' ROM provides
the config for the internal devices manager. The File_system session is used by
the internal FPGA driver and provides the bitstream files.

In return, the package provides a Platform session. Moreover, reporting of the
platform driver can be enabled via the 'policy' ROM. The reports are routed to
the parent.
