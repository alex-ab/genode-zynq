Driver for powering, initialising and configuring a Xilinx FPGA via the
PCAP interface.

An examplary configuration of the component is shown below:

! <config bitstream="/bitstreams/fpga.bit" enable="yes">
!   <vfs>
!     <dir name="bitstreams">
!       <rom name="fpga.bit"/>
!     </dir>
!   </vfs>
! </config>

The bitstream to be loaded is made available to the component via the vfs. The
path where the bitstream is found must thus be specified by the 'bitstream'
attribute. The state of the FPGA, i.e. whether to load a bitstream or merely
rest the FPGA, is defined by the 'enable' attribute.
