               Device drivers needed for scenarios
                 using the FPGA of the Zynq SoC
                     with a custom bitstream

The package requires two ROM sessions: A bitstream 'fpga.bit', and a config
'fpga_devices.config' specifying the additional devices and policies passed to
the platform driver once the bitstream has been loaded.
In return, the package provides a Platform session.
