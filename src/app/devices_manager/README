The devices manager generates a devices report to be used by the platform
driver depending on the currently loaded bitstream.

For this purpose, the component requires a 'devices' ROM and an 'fpga_state'
ROM. The former contains the static devices of the platform whereas the latter
provides the FPGA state as reported by the FPGA driver (contains bitstream name
and status).

The driver manager copies the content from the 'devices' ROM to its devices
report.

If any bitstream has been loaded, the devices manager will also look for a
'<bitstream>' node in its config with a matching 'name' attribute and copy the
content of the '<devices>' sub node into the report.

The component configuration is structured as follows:

! <config>
!   <bitstream name="...">
!     <devices>
!       [...]
!     </devices>
!   </bitstream>
!   <bitstream name="...">
!     <devices>
!       [...]
!     </devices>
!   </bitstream>
! </config>
